## datawarehouse_sql_project
This project is structured into three main phases:
1. Building the data warehouse
2. Performing advanced SQL-based analysis on the prepared dataset
3. Visualizing the analytical insights using Power BI

The data architecture chosen by us was a datawarehouse since we had structural data and our main aim was building solid foundation for reporting and business intelligence. Datawarehouse is basically a subject oriented, integrated, time variant and non-volatile cllection of data in support of management's decision making process.
